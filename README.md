# Titanic Classification Project
Welcome to the Titanic Classification project repository! ðŸš¢ In this project, I, as a Data Science Intern at Bharat Intern, had the incredible opportunity to dive into the captivating world of Data Science and Machine Learning. Using the renowned Titanic dataset, I aimed to create a powerful model to predict the fate of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various factors such as economic status, age, and gender.
# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to leverage Data Science techniques to analyze and predict whether a passenger survived or not during the tragic Titanic voyage. The project involved the following key steps:

**Data Exploration:** I began by exploring and understanding the Titanic dataset. This included gaining insights into the available features and their distributions.

**Data Preprocessing:** To prepare the data for modeling, I performed data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

**Feature Engineering:** I creatively engineered new features to potentially improve the model's predictive power.

**Model Building:** I experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression, to build a predictive model.

**Model Evaluation:** I rigorously evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step allowed me to fine-tune the model for optimal results.

**Deployment:** Once satisfied with the model's performance, I deployed it to make predictions on new data.
